# initializing-different-types-of-variables- 

A variable is a name of the memory location. It is used to store data. Its value can be changed, and it can be reused many times.
It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily identified.
The example of declaring the variable is given below:
int a;  
float b;  
char c;  
Here, a, b, c are variables. The int, float, char are the data types.

Rules for defining variables
A variable can have alphabets, digits, and underscore.
A variable name can start with the alphabet, and underscore only. It can't start with a digit.
No whitespace is allowed within the variable name.
A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword, e.g. int, float, etc.

Types of Variables in C
There are many types of variables in c:

local variable
global variable
static variable
automatic variable
external variable

Data Types in C
A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, character, etc.

Basic Data Types
The basic data types are integer-based and floating-point based. C language supports both signed and unsigned literals.

The memory size of the basic data types may change according to 32 or 64-bit operating system.

Keywords in C
A keyword is a reserved word. You cannot use it as a variable name, constant name, etc. There are only 32 reserved words (keywords) in the C language.

C Identifiers
C identifiers represent the name in the C program, for example, variables, functions, arrays, structures, unions, labels, etc. An identifier can be composed of letters such as uppercase, lowercase letters, underscore, digits, but the starting letter should be either an alphabet or an underscore. If the identifier is not used in the external linkage, then it is called as an internal identifier. If the identifier is used in the external linkage, then it is called as an external identifier.

Rules for constructing C identifiers
The first character of an identifier should be either an alphabet or an underscore, and then it can be followed by any of the character, digit, or underscore.
It should not begin with any numerical digit.
In identifiers, both uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Therefore, we can say that identifiers are case sensitive.
Commas or blank spaces cannot be specified within an identifier.
Keywords cannot be represented as an identifier.
The length of the identifiers should not be more than 31 characters.
Identifiers should be written in such a way that it is meaningful, short, and easy to read.

Types of identifiers
Internal identifier
External identifier
Internal Identifier

If the identifier is not used in the external linkage, then it is known as an internal identifier. The internal identifiers can be local variables.

External Identifier

If the identifier is used in the external linkage, then it is known as an external identifier. The external identifiers can be function names, global variables.

C Operators
An operator is simply a symbol that is used to perform operations. There can be many types of operations like arithmetic, logical, bitwise, etc.

There are following types of operators to perform different types of operations in C language.

Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Shift Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Ternary or Conditional Operators
Assignment Operator
Misc Operator

C Format Specifier
The Format specifier is a string used in the formatted input and output functions. The format string determines the format of the input and output. The format string always starts with a '%' character.

Escape Sequence in C
An escape sequence in C language is a sequence of characters that doesn't represent itself when used inside string literal or character.

It is composed of two or more characters starting with backslash \. For example: \n represents new line.

Constants in C
A constant is a value or variable that can't be changed in the program, for example: 10, 20, 'a', 3.4, "c programming" etc.

There are different types of constants in C programming.
